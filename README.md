# Balatro Multiplayer Server

TCP game server for [Balatro Multiplayer](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer). Handles lobby management, game state synchronization, and PvP logic between two players.

## Overview

- **Transport:** Raw TCP sockets on port `8788`, newline-delimited JSON messages
- **Protocol:** Each message is a JSON object followed by `\n`
- **Keep-alive:** Server sends `keepAlive` after 5s of inactivity, retries 3 times at 2.5s intervals before closing the connection
- **Security:** No TLS or client verification. The server operates on good faith that clients are not tampered with.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Message Flow

1. Client connects via TCP
2. Server sends `connected` and `version`
3. Client sends `username` with mod hash
4. Client creates or joins a lobby
5. Game actions flow between clients through the server
6. Server maintains authoritative state for lives, scores, and PvP outcomes

## Modded Actions

The modded action system allows third-party mods to use the server as a relay without needing dedicated server-side action handlers.

### How It Works

1. Client sends `moddedAction` with a `modId`, `modAction`, and arbitrary extra fields
2. Server validates the client is in a lobby
3. Server attaches a `from` field (`"host"` or `"guest"`) identifying the sender
4. Server forwards the message to the target (`"nemesis"` for opponent only, `"all"` for both players)
5. The `target` field is stripped before relay; all other fields are forwarded as-is

### Client-Side API

**Sending**:

Key-Values inside the third parameter are custom parameters that will be forwarded to the recipient and can have any non-reserved key

```lua
-- Send to opponent (default)
MP.ACTIONS.modded("MyMod", "syncState", { hp = 20, damage = 5 })

-- Broadcast to all players in the lobby
MP.ACTIONS.modded("MyMod", "announce", { message = "hello" }, "all")
```

**Receiving**:

```lua
function your_mod_sync_state(data)
    -- data.modId, data.modAction, data.from, and all custom fields are available
    -- data.from is "host" or "guest" (set by the server)
    do_something(data.from, data.hp)
end

-- If registered during your mod's initialization then SMODS.current_mod.id is captured automatically
MP.register_mod_action("syncState", your_mod_sync_state)

-- When registering outside of your mod's initialization pass your mod ID as the third parameter
MP.register_mod_action("syncState", your_mod_sync_state, "MyMod")
```

### Wire Format

*Includes the custom hp and damage parameters from the above examples*

```json
{
    "action": "moddedAction",
    "modId": "MyMod",
    "modAction": "syncState",
    "target": "nemesis",
    "from": "host",
    "hp": 20,
    "damage": 5
}
```

### Registering Action Handlers

There are two ways to register handlers depending on your mod's SMODS priority.

**During initialization (recommended):** If your mod has an SMODS priority higher than `10000000` (the Multiplayer mod's priority), `MP.register_mod_action` will be available when your mod loads. In this case your mod ID is captured automatically from `SMODS.current_mod`:

```lua
-- Top-level in your mod file, no mod ID needed
MP.register_mod_action("syncState", your_handler)
```

**Deferred registration:** If your mod requires a specific priority lower than Multiplayer's, `MP.register_mod_action` won't be available at init time. You'll need to register your handlers later by passing your mod ID explicitly as the third parameter. One approach is to poll for the function's existence with an event:

```lua
G.E_MANAGER:add_event(Event({
    blockable = false,
    blocking = false,
    no_delete = true,
    func = function()
        if not MP or not MP.register_mod_action then return false end
        MP.register_mod_action("syncState", your_handler, "MyMod")
        return true
    end,
}))
```

This event runs every frame without interfering with game events, and self-removes the moment registration succeeds. Since Multiplayer loads during SMODS init, this will resolve before the main menu appears.

Be careful with deferred registration — if an opponent sends a modded action before your handler is registered, it will be silently dropped.

### Notes

- `MP.ACTIONS.modded` can be called at runtime with any `modId`, allowing cross-mod communication
- The server performs no validation on mod-specific fields; it is purely a relay
- Avoid using `action`, `modId`, `modAction`, `from`, or `target` as custom parameter names to prevent collisions
